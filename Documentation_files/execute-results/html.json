It is intended for students and analysts who want simple, reusable tools for working with U.S. demographic and statistical data.\n\nThis package provides:\n- Data cleaning tolls\n- Data analysis functions\n- Runnable streamlit app\n\n## Installation \n\nYou can install the required dependencies using:\n```{bash}\nuv pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nTo install the package locally:\n```{bash}\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n## Package Structure\n\n```{text}\nUSAData/\n├── analysis.py # Data analysis functions\n├── cleaning.py # Data cleaning utilities\n├── streamlit_app.py # Streamlit application\n├── data/ # Included datasets\n└── __init__.py\n```\n\n## Modules and Functions\n\n### `cleaning.py`\nContains functions for preparing and cleaning raw datasets. Note there are several functions in this file that use an API to source and piece together the dataset. If the polished dataset is all that is needed use the code below to acquire a dataframe that sources data included in the package. \n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom usadata.cleaning import US\n\nclean_df = USdata()\n```\n\n### `analysis.py`\nProvides functions for T-Tests and regression analysis.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nfrom usadata.analysis import TTests\n\nTTests(clean_df)\n```\n\n### `streamlit_app.py`\nLaunches an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualizing U.S. data.\n\nTo run the app:\n```bash\nstreamlit run streamlit_app.py\n```\n\n## Data\n\nThe `data/` directory in the `src/usadata` directory contains packaged datasets that are accessed internally using `importlib.resources`. These datasets are used in the functions that use the final polished dataset and also for sourcing some of the states data that requires excel files to merge the data. \n\n## Dependencies\n\nKey dependencies include:\n- pandas\n- streamlit\n- plotly\n- us\n- numpy\n- scipy\n- statsmodels\n- httpx\n- geopandas\n- requests\n\nSee `requirements.txt` for the full list.\n\n---\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```python\nimport usaata\nfrom usadata.cleaning import USdata\nfrom usadata.analysis import TTests, regression analysis\n\nclean_df = USdata()\nTTests(clean_df)\nregression_analysis(clean_df)\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n\n## Authors\n\nCreated by Rebekah Jensen and Noah Champagne as part of a course project.\n\n\n## Notes\n\nThis package was built using the modern Python packaging standard (`pyproject.toml`) and `uv_build`.\n\n",
